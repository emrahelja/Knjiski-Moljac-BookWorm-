Knjiški Moljac is a cross-platform book tracking app built with .NET MAUI. It allows users to:

View a list of books with cover images, titles, and authors

Add, update, and delete books from their collection

Track reading progress with status indicators like “Still reading 🙂” and “Finished 😀”

The UI is built using XAML and leverages MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clean separation of concerns.
The app uses data binding, commands, and event-to-command behaviors to provide a responsive and intuitive experience.
